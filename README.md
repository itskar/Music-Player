# Music-Player
Music player application built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. 
Plays a number of songs pulled from a local directory. The navigation bar can be used to pause, play, go to the next song or go to a previous song.
The player also automatically plays the next song once the current song is completed. The info panel pops up once a user hits the play button, and 
displays the title of the song and the elapsed time along with a volume slider that. Users can also click on any part of the song duration to skip 
to that part of the song.
